# Do It Yourself

Now that you've absorbed all this knowledge, it's time to try it out!

Create a simple application in your favourite language and use Docker and Drone
to build and test it. Consider trying a multi-stage build approach to avoid
bundling build artifacts into the final image. If you use Java, try using the
JDK base image to build a jar, and the JRE image to run it.
